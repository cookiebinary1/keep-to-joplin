# Google Keep to Joplin Converter

A tool to convert Google Keep notes (exported via Google Takeout) into Markdown files suitable for importing into Joplin. Available as both a command-line tool and a GUI application.

## Features

- **Converts Notes**: Handles both regular text notes and checklist notes.
- **Preserves Metadata**: Keeps creation and modification timestamps.
- **Tag Support**: Converts Google Keep labels to Joplin tags (via frontmatter).
- **Status Handling**: Preserves Pinned, Archived, and Trashed status.
- **Safe Filenames**: Generates unique, slugified filenames based on note titles.
- **No Dependencies**: Written in pure Python 3 using only the standard library (CLI version).
- **Standalone Executable**: GUI version available as a standalone macOS executable (no Python required).

## Prerequisites

**For CLI version:**
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- A Google Takeout export containing Google Keep data.

**For GUI executable:**

## Usage

1.  **Export Data**: Download your Google Keep data from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).
2.  **Extract**: Unzip the downloaded file. You should see a `Takeout/Keep` directory containing `.json` files.
3.  **Run the Tool**:

./dist/keep_to_joplin
```
Then use the graphical interface to select input and output directories.

**Building the standalone executable:**
See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for instructions on building the standalone GUI executable.
